# cla-collection
This is a collection of programs for cross-cutting concerns in C. This means all these programs should handle expected functionalities as logging, error-handling or other. 
## Files and streams
- files vs. streams,
- header files needed for stream operations,
- FILE structure,
- opening and closing a stream, open modes, errno variable,
- reading and writing to/from a stream,
- predefined streams: stdin, stdout and stderr,
- stream manipulation: fgetc(), fputc(), fgets() and fputs() functions,
- raw input/output: fread() and fwrite() functions.

## Preprocessor and complex declarations
- preprocessor,
- #include: how to make use of a header file,
- #define: simple and parameterized macros,
- #undef directive,
- predefined preprocessor symbols,
- macrooperators: # and ##,
- conditional compilation: #if and #ifdef directives,
- avoiding multiple compilations of the same header files,
- scopes of declarations, storage classes,
- user â€“defined types,
- pointers to functions,
- analyzing and creating complex declarations.
